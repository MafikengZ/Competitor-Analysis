See how:  “I created Komposair, a web app that generates music using artificial intelligence, using the skills I gained from completing the Deep Learning Specialization and DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program.  My goal was to help musicians in the creative process. Sometimes, as a composer, I have a music idea (motif) that I would love to use in my music but I’m not sure how to further develop the motif. In those moments, I thought that AI could help the composer by providing different melodies that use the starting motif.  Music has a lot to do with patterns, and AI is great at recognizing patterns. In the future, I would like to expand Komposair to add more models based on different types of music (for instance, the last model I added is based on Chinese music).   I see the workflow like this: A composer has a motif → She goes to Komposair to generate ideas based on this motif → She selects one of the melodies given by Komposair and downloads it as a MIDI file → She now adds harmony, changes a little bit of the melody (if necessary) and when it's ready, she creates a music piece out of this.

Pretend to teach your topic to a classroom. Make sure you're able to explain the topic in simple terms.  3. Go back to the books when you get stuck. The gaps in your knowledge should be obvious.

Here are some words of advice from Charissa, a recently retired nurse (nearly 40 years in the field!) who turned to Coursera to take on new learning challenges:    “Don't give up! I found myself getting frustrated when I didn't understand all the concepts, acronyms, and terms in a lecture. Then I remembered wearing out a medical dictionary in my first semester in nursing. I didn't start out being a confident, expert critical care nurse. Learning something new is tough. It gets easier. Stick with it. That ‘ah-ha’ moment when you comprehend is worth it.”",1/8/2020 20:26,1/9/2020 11:34,1,73,66,7,0,0,0,0,66

""I decided to switch from restaurant management to a career in IT for several reasons. My wife and I were expecting our first child while I was taking the classes, so I decided to move into a career that I was passionate about. I was an excellent restaurant manager, but I excelled at it without any passion. It was just a job. I was on call around the clock, and I could never take time for myself at home. I wanted to be able to provide a better life for my family while giving myself a better life, too. With my new career, I can now leave work at the office and enjoy time with my son!""
