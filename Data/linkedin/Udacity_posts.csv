Hence, as part of Pitch the Future 2022, a new Shell Eco-marathon competition aimed at STEM students we introduce: Cognitive Boost for Autonomous Vehicles - A #ShellAI Challenge. Autonomous vehicles are classified based on their capability to navigate ranging from Level 1: Driver Assistance; to Level 5: Complete Autonomation; but is the navigation capability enough to replace the human driver? In partnership with Udacity we invited the participating #ShellEcoMarathon students to flex their STEM skills with this new world challenge and pitch their ideas in response to the question: “How can the human factor be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI) to create a seamless autonomous vehicle (AV) experience?”Catch the webinar recording and Q&A aimed at participating Shell Eco-marathon teams on our website for more information around this fascinating challenge.  https://lnkd.in/dWdRYxUJ #PoweringProgress Dean Dan Pinar Hayley Leanne Bin Gilles Natalie Zhi-Ying Hariharasudhan Deepa Claire Suchismita Karina James Jens Tulin Vidyasagar P Ajith Kaushic Nikhil Laksha Sharanya Tanvi Thanooj",10,0,0,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D22AQFWPuG0VPI_TQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1645107254597?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=mCSlTqb1nSMHhhQCi0BdZpWcKMzACz8AvJ3fSJPUjks,"339,805 followers"
