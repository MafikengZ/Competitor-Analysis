The last two decades have witnessed unprecedented development in the mobility sector, with the autonomous vehicle (AV) at the pinnacle of it. These developments ensure that AVs are crucial for energy transition. Hence, as part of Pitch the Future 2022, a new Shell Eco-marathon competition aimed at STEM students we introduce: Cognitive Boost for Autonomous Vehicles - A #ShellAI Challenge. Autonomous vehicles are classified based on their capability to navigate ranging from Level 1: Driver Assistance; to Level 5: Complete Autonomation; but is the navigation capability enough to replace the human driver? In partnership with Udacity we invited the participating #ShellEcoMarathon students to flex their STEM skills with this new world challenge and pitch their ideas in response to the question: “How can the human factor be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI) to create a seamless autonomous vehicle (AV) experience?”Catch the webinar recording and Q&A aimed at participating Shell Eco-marathon teams on our website for more information around this fascinating challenge.  https://lnkd.in/dWdRYxUJ #PoweringProgress Dean Dan Pinar Hayley Leanne Bin Gilles Natalie Zhi-Ying Hariharasudhan Deepa Claire Suchismita Karina James Jens Tulin Vidyasagar P Ajith Kaushic Nikhil Laksha Sharanya Tanvi Thanooj",10,0,N/A,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D22AQFWPuG0VPI_TQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1645107254597?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=mCSlTqb1nSMHhhQCi0BdZpWcKMzACz8AvJ3fSJPUjks,"339,780 followers"
