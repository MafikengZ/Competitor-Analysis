As I got older, I started to think more about how technology can help people improve their lives, especially those in third world countries. I decided to pursue a career in data science because it affords me the freedom to apply my skills in virtually any sector I want.  From an early age, the gender stereotypes of “boys are better at STEM subjects than girls” dampened my motivation towards my studies. It took great commitment to be able to push myself into the tech industry; but what really helped me the most was the empowerment from other women and girls in tech.   I’ve learned a lot from the experiences of the women before me, and I hope by being where I’m at now, I can help younger girls remember that they are just as capable as anyone else.""",8/8/2019 10:23,8/8/2019 10:23,0,7,5,2,0,0,0,0,5

Check out what she has to say about being a female in the tech industry:   ""I decided to pursue [a tech career] as it seemed flexible and engaging enough to adapt to whatever future I was heading towards.  I think the biggest [challenge for me] is imposter syndrome - the belief that you don't belong or don't know what you are doing and that it is a mistake you were given the job in the first place. This is a problem amongst many people in tech, but particularly women.  But at some point you figure out what you are good at and how to ask for help on the things you're bad at. Eventually, you realise no one really knows what they're doing and we are all just trying our best.  My advice is to not undervalue yourself. Apply for the jobs you think you are under-qualified for, ask for the salary you actually deserve, and speak up in meetings when you have something to say.""",8/7/2019 10:18,8/7/2019 18:52,1,17,12,5,0,0,0,0,12
