134,"And the wait is over! Ajay, congratulations on the win & a big thank you for sharing your wonderful story of how Ambition #CannotBeLockedDown — it was inspiring, motivating, and full of optimism. We’d also like to thank each participant for an overwhelming response. We really appreciate it! 👏👏  Here's sharing Ajay's story, in his own words:   ""Hey EveryOne! I recently came across a contest by Simplilearn to speak about our last 1 year's journey. This is not to win but to all those who may be in the same situation in which I was previously. Here's mine. While this pandemic showed us the flip side of life, it also showed us how to value our lives. Oh yes, that lockdown and the pandemic has taught us, rather the hard way, about life; we’ve shared quotes and forwards about how important it is to lead our lives the way we want to and how important it is to live the moment and so on but how many of us have actually done that than just getting along with the routine?  The notion and idea of “slowing down” reached us only during these 14 months at home but how if I say I transformed that idea to "" accelerate "". Yes, you heard it right I did it with Simplilearn. We were all chasing our “dreams” and trying to compete, and so does I but in a different way. So what was it?   Two resignations and #continuouslearning with a strong belief and passion to pursue a career in Software Engineering leaving behind the career of Customer Solutions and support and this begin with Simplilearn. For the very first time when I heard about DevOps in one of its Linkedin posts on Master's program in DevOps Architect.   I'm thankful to #simplilearn for its course which helped me to progress and earn that certification. The reason was to complete the project, I have to learn those technologies which forced me to prepare and improve my skillsets. Also, follow-up calls from Simplilearn for help and guidance if I am stuck somewhere. My heartiest thanks to all those Simplilearn people who suppose to call and ask me for timely feedback.   So where I'm now and what I'm doing.?   My first step in DevOps helped me to initiate my career in this domain. Earlier I had tried multiple companies but had faced rejections of course for not being a good coder so I decided to shift my career in #DevOps. I really started developing interests when Tanveer, Markanday use to teach the Agile and DB concepts while Srikanth and Sonal for Devops stack and AWS. I left my 1st job where I was making 35k monthly and joined a company as a Software Engineer trainee with 10k monthly. Seems crazy right !!! But it's true.  One more shift just because I dint got a DevOps role and preferred to remain jobless for 2 months but continued learning, revising concepts of #DevOps and #cloudcomputing. Finally, in my next interview, I was asked "" Ajay you mentioned something Master's in DevOps Architect can you brief me about it "". I handled this with all the best knowledge I have at that time, answering most of the questions. I grab that offer and joined. Now again there's a change and it's a #DevOpsConsultant this time with a new organization. So this was my journey in the past 14 months where I can proudly say #simplilearn has its contribution in achieving from a Non-techie to a Techie role in the DevOps domain.”",10/6/2021 15:31,10/6/2021 15:46,0,4,3,1,0,0,0,0,3

However, often these free resources do not provide the expected quality. When I first took the course - Introduction to Project Management, I didn’t think I’d learn anything that I can use in real life.  But when I had to lead a large project with a cross-department team, I began to study Project Management more deeply. The SkillUp course turned out to be extremely helpful. I could practice all the lessons learned in my work (and in my personal life). The course quality is excellent and in no way inferior to paid ones. I feel really grateful for this platform.

RESEARCH Go deep - explore more about the field and careers in it - what will they be like in 5 or 10 years? Read more on it, and listen to experts in the field by way of podcasts or videos.  KNOW THE GROUND REALITY Know what it means to work in the field - Connect with practitioners and get to know the demands of the job, the challenges they've faced, and what it takes to succeed in it.

BREAK your journey down into long term and short term goals. Break them down further into smaller actionable steps with realistic deadlines. Savor the small successes and learn from the mistakes. They will make you appreciate the journey and fuel your passion.  3. Practice Visualization. As corny as it sounds, if done right, it can go a long way in boosting your morale. IMAGINE what'd you feel and be able to do once you achieve your goals.  4. Fuel your positivity by surrounding yourself with LIKE-MINDED people, reading, listening, and watching success stories.  5. Remember- it's okay not to feel motivated all the time. Take a PAUSE, enjoy some time off with your family and friends, or pursue a recreational activity that helps you relax.  6.

450,"Well, there are many best practices and habits that contribute to building a successful career. We’ve rounded up the best 10 here that have proven most effective;  1. Who you work with and Why are as important as where and how much you work for.  2. Have a plan, but also be ready to change it if needed.  3. Don’t just wait for things to fall into place. Be your own boss where it counts the most, and make it happen.  4. Be future-ready. Learn something new every day and always keep yourself updated.  5. It’s great to be the smartest one in the room, but don’t act like one, no matter what stage of the career you are at.  6. Aim not for perfection, but being better than yesterday.  7. Your hard skills can only get you so far. Invest in soft skills too.  8. Time, money, and attitude does matter.  9. Execution matters more than plans or advice.  10.

456,"Question: HOW DO YOU PLAN TO ACHIEVE YOUR CAREER GOALS?  Once you’ve clarity on the why, what, & where you want to be in your career, here are some steps to help you get there:  1. To start off, break down your goals into detailed, actionable steps with realistic deadlines. You can work backward from your goals to list out these steps.  2. Once armed with this detailed plan, commit to it. Hard work & smart work are essential to make this work, not to mention patience & perseverance. Surrounding yourself with like-minded people helps in keeping the motivation high too.  3. Invest in enhancing your skillset. There are tons of options to do this - from free to paid ones. Free online courses (bit.ly/SkillUp-free-online-courses) are a great way to learn the fundamentals well before moving on to paid courses. Webinars can be a great source of invaluable insights, while networking can open up new opportunities. With your basics sorted, you can move to options that need more time & financial commitments like a paid certification or attending industry conferences.  4.

468,"Question: WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF IN 5 YEARS?  Just how many times have you been asked this question? This is THE ultimate classic interview quintessential. The key here is to introspect. Ask yourself - what is it that you want to achieve in the coming years? Pen your thoughts and career-plan based on these factors:  Which industry do you want to work in? Consider here – which sector is the most promising for your qualifications and interests. Which industry pays well and is aligned with your goals?  What position do you want to be in? Team Lead? Assistant Manager? Manager of Operations? Aim high but precise. Plan the route.  What is your dream company(s)? There is much to evaluate when picking a firm - work culture, growth opportunities, the mission. Does the company align with your career aims?  What kind of professional do you want to be? Analyze how you'd like your personality to develop. Want to be a better orator? Or more data-driven? Match these goals with your career ones.  Honest answers to these questions can give you the clarity to identify and start learning the skills you need to bridge the gap and get to your dream job or company, or destination fast. Remember: the future is still unwritten; it is for you to make it what you want it to be.  #ThinkingOutLoud",11/24/2020 14:30,11/24/2020 14:30,0,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,1

Technology was already moving at a fast pace, But today, businesses are forced to relook at their operating models. Are you sure your current skill is sufficient to keep up with the changes? If not, then it's time to invest in upskilling.  2. BE PREPARED FOR YOUR MOMENT- Opportunities do not give a heads-up. Either you are prepared for them, or you aren't. Upskilling is all about preparing yourself for that next job opportunity or giving yourself a chance to lead that high-visibility project, or managing the team through a critical phase.  3. REVIVE THE PASSION - We all start our journey with much enthusiasm, which fades over time; it is but natural. By helping broaden our knowledge and capabilities, Upskilling gives us a chance to fall in love with our interests once again. And with this newfound motivation, you can fuel your journey towards your career goals.  4. NOT LIMITED TO PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS - Professional skills can sometimes come in handy in our personal lives too. Eg: Learning the importance of a contingency fund in project management can lead to realizing the importance of the same in personal life too.  #ThinkingOutLoud",11/20/2020 8:30,11/20/2020 8:30,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

486,"Question: HOW LONG SHOULD YOU STICK TO A NEW JOB BEFORE CHANGING IT?  While the ideal answer is when you realize this isn't what you want to do in the long run, it doesn't always make for a practical one.  Start by updating your resume & observe the duration of your past jobs. Do they make you seem like a Job Hopper? (Stability is important, & any employer would be wary of choosing someone with a track record of not sticking around.)  If the answer's YES, then quitting the new job in <2 years of joining may not be a good idea.  If the answer is NO, then here are few more reasons to consider before you call it quits; 1. You're currently in the middle of a crucial project 2. You're about to get a bonus or annual appraisal 3. You have no savings or new opportunities currently  If you'd still like to move on: Remember, there's no perfect workplace or job. Everything comes with its own challenges. You can only decide which ones would make your time worthwhile.  Also, time matters. Give it some time and thought. Your opinion about the job today is quite different from when you joined, right?  Moving On: While looking for the next opportunity, be sure that it doesn't come with a lot of the same things that led you to this point with your current job.

499,"Question: IS TAKING A BREAK FROM WORK JUSTIFIED?  Well, ask yourself;  1. WHY? - Why do you need a break? Taking some time away from work isn't wrong, & your health, both physical & mental, realigning your priorities, & exploring new career paths can be some very pertinent reasons.  2. WHAT? - What are you planning on doing, having taken a break? Use this time as an opportunity to strengthen your skills or develop new ones. Consider traveling and exploring, mastering a passion. They can help clear your mind and let you discover your next step.  3. WHEN? - By when are you planning to start on your new line of work? You cannot be on a break forever. Set reasonable and realistic deadlines & come up with an action plan. This way, you not only give yourself enough time to refuel but also ensure that you aren't ""whiling"" away precious time.  4. HOW? - How are you planning to go about it? An analysis of your current skillset & mapping them to your desired destination is a great way to determine what to do next. Also, be prepared to address the 'break situation' with potential employers. Highlight how this pause has made you come back stronger.  Remember, there's no good or bad decision.

Below is a testimonial sent by Paul to Simplilearn,  ""I recently passed the PMP exam having completed Simplilearn’s four day classroom training program about a month earlier.  I prepared for the classroom portion by going through the online classes and then reviewed those sessions after the classroom portion as well.  What was particularly helpful, in addition to the classroom learning and practice exam on the final day, was to go through the online practice exams.  The online practice exams helped me to identify areas of the five processes in which I was weaker and to strengthen my understanding of those processes.  I’ve heard it said that “the more you sweat in practice, the less you bleed in battle” and the Simplilearn program was a critical element in my preparation for passing the exam the first time.  I highly recommend the program.""",5/21/2012 6:14,5/21/2012 6:14,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,2

9540,"PMP stands for Project Management Professional. Its the name of the certificate awarded to any one who scores more than the required passing mark in the PMP Exam. So if you successfully pass the PMP Exam, you become a Project Management Professional ie PMP. As evident by the name itself, this certificate is of interest to any one interested in Project Management as a career. Let me tell you, PMP is most recognized Individual certification in the area of Project Management. Its valued Worldwide. For many of the Project Management Jobs, its even a mandatory qualification. PMP is not for Project Managers from a specific domain. A Project Manager working in any Industry, be it Manufacturing or Retail or Defense or Information Technology can write the PMP Exam and upon successful completion can become a PMP. Now lets look at What is PMI? PMI is a not for profit Organization, who conducts PMP Examination. PMI stands for Project Management Institute. PMI is based in USA and it has local chapter across the globe. So, if you are based in Singapore, you can look for PMI chapter in Singapore. Such local chapters conduct regular knowledge sharing and networking session for people interested in Project Management. If you need more information about the PMI, you can check out their website, www.pmi.org A PMP certificate is valid for only three years. Post completion of this three year period. It can be renewed for another three years. PMI measures Project Management Experience in units of PDU. PDU means Professional Development Unit. So, if you attend a Project Management Class of 1 hour by an expert, its equivalent to say 1 PDU. If you write a White Paper on Project Management related topic, it may be equivalent to 5 PDU. PMI has detailed guideline on what kind of project management activity amounts to how many PDUs. You can check their website for more details. Every three years, one must have acquire 60 PDUs to retain their PMP certificate. So first time, when you write the exam, you become PMP for 3 years. After this period, to renew your PMP credentials, you need to submit proof that you acquired at least 60 PDUs in last three year and pay the PMI certificate renewal fee, your certificate gets renewed for another three years. You can conveniently do this online at www.pmi.org Finally, lets look at what is PMBOK? PMBOK means Project Management Body of Knowledge. Its a Book that PMI releases every four years. The latest version of the PMBOK is version 4 and it was released in June 2009. PMBOK acts as a Text Book for the PMP Exam. You can also think of PMBOK as Standard for Project Management Profession.",6/30/2010 7:22,11/11/2015 16:37,1,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6
9541,"Well, Can anyone take up the PMP Examination? Yes, provided one meets certain prerequisite. The prerequisite depends upon persons formal education. As shown in the table, for bachelor degree holder, they have to have at least 4500 hours of Project Management experience and for someone whose highest formal education is High school degree, its 7500 hours of Project management experience. In addition to this, there is some requirement in terms of total no of years of work experience as well. For the first category, one has to have at least 6 years of total work experience and for the second category its 8 years. The 3 years within 6 years in the table means that 4500 hours of project management experience should have happened in last 3 years of total 6 years of experience. Lastly, one also has to show proof of attending 35 hours of Project Management Training just before writing the PMP exam. There are many Project Management Training companies, who are PMI REP. Now, what is REP? PMI REP training institute means, these training companies are registered with PMI as Registered Education Provider. If you attend their 35 hour contact training, they also give you 35 PDUs. As I explained earlier, PDU means professional development unit. Its a measure of Project management activity by PMI. Attending Project Management training is also a Project Management Activity. I would like to clarify here that even if you attend 35 hours of Project Management Training by a company, which is not REP, you can still go ahead and take up the PMP exam. But you must show proof of attending 35 hours of Project Management training, which is inline with PMI guidelines. So, if you have gone through our complete 14 lesson material and also attended our virtual classes. You qualify to take up the PMP Exam. Let me also inform you that, One has to submit proof of everything (ie your educational Degree, your Project Management Experience, etc) to PMI while submitting the online application for taking up the exam. PMI randomly audits such submission from time to time. So, If you do not meet the prerequisite and still go ahead and submit the online exam application, there are chances of you getting caught. PMI disqualifies such application. Also, Once your online application for taking up the exam gets approved, PMI sends an Authorization letter. You must write the exam, within a year of getting the Authorization letter.",6/30/2010 7:08,6/30/2010 7:08,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3
9542,"Critical Path is another technique to do the Schedule Network Analysis. Its again a very popular technique and we will study this method in next few slides. First, let me explain what is a critical Path? Critical path is defined as the longest duration path through a network diagram and determines the shortest time to complete the project. We will shortly learn on how to identify a critical path in a network. Float is another concept, which is quiet important in understanding the critical path. Float is calculated once the network diagram is ready. There are three kind of float that can be calculated. The first being the Total Float, which is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the project end date or an intermediary milestone. The second type of float is Free Float which is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of its successor(s) activities. The last type is Project Float which is the amount of time a Project can be delayed without delaying the externally imposed project completion date required by the customer or previously committed by the Project Manager. You can think of float as a cushion time available to complete an activity. Float is also called slack. Now, let me ask you. What is the slack of the activities on the critical path? The answer is Zero. Because, there is no scope to delay activities on the critical path. Critical Path actually represents the Project duration. They actually add together to the Project duration, so where is the scope for the delay? Delaying activities on the critical path is as good as delaying the project duration!",6/30/2010 7:01,6/30/2010 7:01,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,2
9544,"Earned Value Technique is an excellent way to track the Project Progress against the Project Plan. Its a method of objectively measuring project performance against the Project baseline. Result from an Earned Value analysis indicate deviation of the Project from cost and schedule baselines Let me quickly ask you what is a Baseline? I have already explained this earlier..but just to provide a quick recapbaseline means first approved value. So schedule baseline means, the first approved Project Schedule. There are various terms used in Earned Value Techniques. All these terms are listed in this slide. Please go through the same. They are quiet self explanatory. For example, PV, meaning Planned Value, is the Estimated Value of the Work Planned to be done. This value is measured in terms of currency, say dollar. So, if planned value is $340, it was planned to do work worth 340 dollars. But, how do you calculate Earned Value? Its quiet simple. Just add the budget allocated to each of the activities that have completed at that point in time. The resulting value is Earned Value at point of time. All other parameters listed in this slide are also measured in terms of currency only.",6/30/2010 6:55,6/30/2010 6:55,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

The walls are planned to be completed one after the other. Today is the end of day 3; calculate the CPI and SPI of this project. Now, as you can see in the slide, at the end of the day 3, the status of the Project is: Side 1 of the wall is completed within the planned time and budget. Side 2 was planned to get over by 2nd day, but it actually gets completed by 3rd day. It costed $700 instead of $500 to get completed. Side 3 is only 50% done, thought it was supposed to get completed by 3rd day. It costed $300 instead of $250 to get completed. Work on Side 4 has not yet started and it was not even planned to get started.

9548,"I. Topic 11: Project Risk Management A. Slide 1: Introduction  Hello and Welcome to lesson No 11 of PMP Certification Course by SimpliLearn! This lesson is about Project Risk Management. Risk Management is actually a key responsibility of the project manager. Risk management is one of the project management disciplines which have a direct impact on the project success or failure. B. Slide 2: Agenda  This section covers what is Risk, how is risk calculated and the different ways in which risk can be categorized. Next, we will learn about decision tree. This is a very interesting concept...that helps in analyzing risk and its impact on taking decision. Finally, we will learn about the six project management process, which are part of Risk Management knowledge area. C. Slide 3: What is Risk?  Risk can be best defined as an uncertainty that can positively or negatively impact a project. There are some other risk related terms that you should be aware of. For example, Risk Averse, Risk Tolerance, Risk Threshold. D. Slide 4: How is Risk Calculated?  Risk is measured by assigning a monetary value to it and that value is arrived at by multiplying the probability and impact of the risk. E. Slide 5: Risk Categorization  Risk can be categorized in various ways. One such categorization is External, Internal, Technical or Project Management related risk. Risk is based on the origin of the risk. For example, you can classify risks as Schedule Risk, Cost Risk, Quality Risk, Scope Risk or Resource Risk. F. Slide 6: Decision Tree  Suppose you have to buy a car. You can either buy a new car or old car. Which one should you buy? Which has more risk over a period of 5 years? We take help of decision tree concept to solve this type of problem. G. Slide 7: Risk Reserve  This reserve takes care of known uncertainties. This reserve is also called contingency reserve. Once the planned cost is arrived, there is another reserve gets added and that's called management reserve. Now, why is this needed? Well, by adding contingency reserve you have taken care of known uncertainties and by adding management reserve you take care of unknown uncertainties. But on what basis do you add unknown uncertainties, the answer is its totally based on experience or what we also call in PMI language Expert Judgment. Slide 8: Project Risk Management Processes  Project Risk management can be best defined as the process of risk management planning, risk identification, risk analysis, risk response planning and risk monitoring & control on a Project. The key objective of Risk management is to increase the probability and impact of positive events and decrease the probability and impact of negative events. H. Slide 9: Plan Risk Management  This is such an important process that requires involvement of Project Sponsor, Customer and other key stakeholders along with the project manager. Risk Management Plan have information like budget and schedules for risk management activities and that's why it's an input for processes like cost estimation, time estimation, schedule development and cost budgeting. I. Slide 10: Identify Risks  Risk Identification is an ongoing iterative process. Risk can arise any time during the project execution cycle. Even when the project is started the customer or the project sponsor can inform about the possible project risks to the project manager. There are various techniques for Risk Analysis. One of them is documentation reviews and this is a kind of must do technique for risk identification. The output of the risk identification process is Risk register, which is the list of identified risk. J. Slide 11: Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis  The first technique of Qualitative risk analysis is to find out the accuracy of the risk data. Once the accuracy of the risk data is verified, the next step is to find out which risks needs to be addressed on priority and analyzing them on priority. The output of this process is prioritized risks with their probability and impact ratings. The process also results in a list of risks that require further analysis. K. Slide 12: Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis  Quantitative Risk Analysis is the process of quantitatively analyzing the risk data. It includes montecarlo analysis. L. Slide 13: Plan Risk Responses  Those risk for which contingency plan needs to be created are also called Residual Risks. Contingency plans are basically what you can do when the risk actually occurs. M. Slide 14: Monitor & Control Risks  The last step in Risk Management is monitoring and control of the risk management activities that involves tracking identified Risks, monitoring residual risks, identifying new risks and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project. The outputs of this process are updates risk list, for example, some risk that are no longer applicable will get removed from the risk register.",6/29/2010 14:03,6/29/2010 14:03,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,2
9549,"Let me give you an overview of all the lessons of this Tutorial. In all, we have 14 lessons. The current is the first lesson, which is an Introduction to the PMP certification. Lessons 2, which is named as Project Management Framework, aims to explain what Project and Project Management is all about. It also explains some related terms like Program Management, Project Management Office etc. So, Lesson 2 can be considered as an introduction to the Project Management. Next, Lesson 3 aims to explain the five Project management Process Groups that we discussed some time back. Just to recap these process groups are Initiation, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling and Closing. From Lesson 4 till Lesson 12, the 9 Project Management knowledge areas are explained. One lesson dedicated to each of these nine areas. In addition to the 5 process groups and 9 knowledge areas, PMI gives a lot of weightage to professional and social responsibility. There are good amount of questions in exam from this topic as well. So we have dedicated one chapter for this as well. The last lesson, i.e. lesson no 14, is generic in nature and there in we have explained few tips and tricks for the PMP exam. We suggest you to go through it once. It might be of great help. Along with the tips & tricks, we have also listed in lesson 14, what is called PMI-ism. Now, What is PMI-ism? Well, PMI has a certain way of thinking and PMI-ism is a compilation of the same. You might not agree to all of that, but you must know this to pass the PMP Exam. Lets quickly take a look at a PMI-ism example. You must be using the word Taskin your day to ay project execution to mean a Project related work. But, PMI never uses this term; instead they use the word Activity and Work packages. This is PMI-ism. There are many such things that we discuss in lesson 14. At this point, I would also like to add that, at the end of each of these lessons, we have an quiz. I strongly support to take up the quiz and also look at the explanation of the all the questions, those which you got right as well as those which you got it wrong. This would help to get a better grasp over the subject. Once you are through with all these 14 lesson, you can go ahead and start taking our online practice tests.",6/29/2010 9:08,6/29/2010 9:08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9550,"Now, Let me tell you more about the PMP Exam. Its a four hour exam consisting of 200 questions. Out of this 200, 25 questions are not scored. But beware; you will not know which these 25 questions are! So you should answer all 200 questions, with same seriousness. PMI includes these questions to see how many test takers are getting them right. Based on this, they might decide to include these questions in future Exam. Its like a survey conducted by PMI. The pass marks for the exam is 141 out of 175, which roughly translates to 81%! Now, you must be guessing that PMP exam is not that easy. You are right! Taking PMP exam does require certain seriousness in preparation. Next, I have shown in the table on how many questions appear from which part of the syllabus. Getting confused with so many new terms Hold on for a moment! You will learn them in the next slide. For now, assume them to be the six major topics and percentage of questions that typically comes from each of these topics.",6/29/2010 9:06,6/29/2010 9:06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9551,"Now that you have gone through the Earned Value Terms. Lets look at the formulas involved in calculating the Earned Value. Here again, all the formulas are listed in the slide along with their explanation. Remember to note that Negative cost variance means that the project is over budget, positive means the project is under budget. Similarly, Negative schedule variance means that project is behind schedule where as Positive schedule variance means that project is ahead of schedule. The next two parameters i.e. Cost Performance Index (CPI) and Schedule Performance Index (SPI) are also quiet important parameters. Their value varies between 0 and 1. So, if CPI is say 0.8, it means that we are getting 80 cent out of every dollar spent in the Project. If, SPI is say 0.9, it means that project is progressing at only 90% of the speed originally planned. The next parameter is Estimate At Completion. So, at any point of time during the project execution, if it is required to know how much the project would actually cost by the time its gets completed, just divide the Budget At Completion by the Cost Performance Index. What is Budget AT Completion? Its just the Budget of the Total Project. The next parameter is Estimate to Complete, which is how much more would the project cost from this point onwards. This is calculated simply by subtracting Actual Cost from the Estimate at Completion. Also, Variance at Completion can be calculated by subtracting Estimate At Completion from the Budget At Completion.",6/29/2010 9:02,6/29/2010 9:02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

9553,"There are two ways in which float of an activity can be calculated. But before that let me inform you that first step in critical path method is to identify the Critical Path of the Network. Once the critical path is identified, calculate the start date and end date of each of the activities on the critical path. As we have seen earlier, the float of the activities on the critical path is zeroso they represent the overall project duration.  Now, that you know the Project duration. Either you can go through the network starting with time zero and keep on calculating the time required to complete each of the activity till you reach the last activity of the Project. This is also called Forward pass. The starting time for each of the activity in this approach is called Early Start and end time for each activity is called the Early Finish Or you can travel through the network from the project end date and calculate the time required to complete each activity. This is called backward pass. The end date in this approach is called the Late Finish and the start date of the activity in this approach is called the Late Start. The float of the activity is either the difference between the Early Start and Early finish or the difference between the Late Start and Late finish. Both the differences work out to be the same. If you are finding difficulty understanding critical path, I suggest that you go through the last two slides twice and than look at the next slide where in we have explained a critical path example",6/29/2010 7:33,6/29/2010 7:33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9554,"Lets look at this example. There are basically 5 activities in this Project.  If you look at the Network diagram, there are two paths in this Network.  Start, 1, 2, 4, 5, End is one path and Start, 1, 3, 5, End is the second path. Since the duration of the path Start, 1, 2, 4, 5, End is 18 days, which is more than the duration of the path Start, 1, 3, 5, End. The critical path of the Project is Start, 1, 2, 4, 5, End. Take some time to calculate all the four values, i.e. Early Start, Early Finish, Late start and late finish of the activities. I have written down the values for your verification. Let me take Activity 3 as an example. First we will calculate the Early Start and Early Finish dates. Activity 3 can start only after Activity 1. Since the Early finish of Activity 1 is 3, which becomes the Early Start of Activity 3.  Activity 3 can not start earlier than 3, because Activity 1 is getting completed only than. So, Early Start of Activity 3 is 3. Since the duration of the activity is 6 days. The Early Finish of Activity 3 is 3+6= 9 days. Now, lets calculate the late start and late finish of Activity 3.  Late Start of Activity 5 is 14 days. The activity 3 happens just before Activity 5, so the Late Finish of Activity 3 is 14 days. To calculate the late start, you can subtract the duration from late finish. So the Late start of Activity 3 is 14-6=8.",6/29/2010 7:28,6/29/2010 7:28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
