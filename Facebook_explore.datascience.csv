89,"Interpolation is the process of estimating an unknown value that falls between known values. In machine learning, this can be done by fitting a model to data and then using the fitted model to estimate the unknown value based on the model inputs. The machine learning approach can sometimes be overkill for simple cases or might not work when we do not have a rich dataset. In these cases, we can turn to conventional interpolation methods such as cubic or linear interpolation.
