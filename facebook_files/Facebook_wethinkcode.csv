It’s no surprise that we, or even the young people themselves, believe they’ve missed the chance for a better life. But, as more institutions create #accessible and #sustainable pathways to meaningful #employment, my hope is that more young people realise that they have options. Options even after failing matric. Options even after passing matric and still not being able to pursue a particular degree because of limited resources, and options even after they’ve made it into their degree and things didn’t work out half way through for whatever reason.""",2/2/2022 12:00,2/16/2022 10:36,3,81,39,42,0,0,0,0,39

I was struggling a lot with my personal identity and where I fit in society. WeThinkCode_ has really shown me there's more to life than just the place you go.  The most valuable thing I learnt is the ability to teach myself. Before this, I could never learn anything by myself. I always needed a teacher to tell me what to do. I've gained the skill of being proactive and being able to look for answers myself and not rely on someone else.  My future goals in the tech industry are to purely learn as much as I can. I find joy in being able to learn things and being able to solve a new problem every single time.  My advice to the first years is that you should actively try to learn things yourself, go beyond what is expected of you, explore as much as possible, and have the joy of finding out how to solve your assignments in new ways.”   #WTC_Grad2020 #WTC_Alumni",10/24/2020 12:24,11/4/2020 17:46,10,179,128,50,0,1,0,0,128
171,"One of our students graduating this Saturday, Naledi Matutuone, speaks on her experience at WeThinkCode_:  “I’m proud to be a WeThinkCode_ graduate because I truly believe there is nothing like WeThinkCode_ in Africa right now. The unique peer-to-peer learning model encourages creativity and knowledge sharing so we become stronger together.    As a new techy in the industry, I want to bring the joy of learning how to code and doing things by yourself to other people. I believe the best gifts and ideas come from people living in strife or difficult situations because they have problems they want to solve.   If I could give advice to the first years I would say: find a friend. I went through my first year struggling on my own. Use your friends, find friends and use them for help - once you know more than your friend, keep sharing that knowledge with others.” #WTC_Grad2020  #WTC_Alumni",10/22/2020 15:02,10/28/2020 10:55,10,159,105,54,0,0,0,0,105

381,"Teams working on gender equality, innovation and technology from the World Bank Group came together to try to better understand how coding bootcamps can effectively recruit and retain women in their programs.  To fill this knowledge gap, they turned to bootcamp providers and digital skills programs across 22 countries, including #WeThinkCode in South Africa, to gather insights and strategies on recruitment, inclusive program design and making connections to the labor market. The objective was to synthesize these findings into a toolkit that bootcamp providers across the world can test and refine while working to increase the share of women who participate in their programs. The findings might also be useful for policymakers working on other types of skills training programs, including technical and vocational training, as well as entrepreneurship accelerators and incubators.  The final result is the Women Wavemakers: Practical Strategies for Attracting and Retaining Women in Coding Bootcamps report, which has just been released on the WBG’s website.

598,"A few tips for potential WeThinkCoders_ 1) These games have several levels and are therefore sometimes tiring. Complete as many levels as you can in the time allocated. 2) You can play the first game (10 minutes), and then choose to start the second game (2 hours) at a later stage. Once you have started a game, you have to finish it. 3) Don’t be in a rush to play both games today, applications will be open for a while. Make sure you are fresh and have enough time. 4) When playing the games, make sure you are in a quiet place, and that your computer has a fast and reliable Internet connection. 5) In the absence of instructions, do not panic: this is normal, you can figure it out for yourself. Don't give up or lose hope - you can do this!! 6) Google Chrome is preferred, although the game works on most browsers (download the latest version)",4/4/2017 8:00,4/7/2017 14:47,4,20,20,0,0,0,0,0,20

The Hackathon took place over three days, non stop programming, where the students had to team up in groups of two to three people per team. They were required to complete two tasks as efficiently as possible with very strict requirements, making use of no external libraries besides stdlib.h which meant they had to create most of their own functions from scratch in C.  Some feedback from the students: - Team CheatCode - ""The hackathon is quite challenging but it is a bit fun. We discovered how complex things can be made simple""   - Team Dog Star - ""We have learned that there’s always room for improvement"" - Team Grizzlies ""This has helped us improve on our communication skills and also brush up on our multitasking skills."" - Team Black Hole ""Time is very important"" - Team Code Troopers ""We have learned that with better planning we are able to achieve better results"" - team Afro Cyntex - ""This has been a test of our skills and we are having fun while learning from each other""  The winner of the Hackathon will be announced tomorrow evening at the #WTC_Launch event which will be livestreamed tomorrow at 18:30 on Facebook.",5/3/2016 17:13,5/3/2016 20:02,1,42,41,0,0,1,0,0,41

824,"Stories behind our coders  Michael - 19  I finished matric last year (I actually decided to take the test while I was studying for my math prelim). I enjoy coding because I love to find and solve problems. And I always love a good challenge.  WeThinkCode_ is a very different type of challenge. I like how it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. It doesn't even matter how good your marks were in school. If you have the potential to be a good coder you are being given a chance.   Bootcamp is one big challenge. Time management is probably the greatest, as the Bootcamp is always throwing curveballs at you and trying to see how many different tasks you can juggle at the same time.   Most of the memorable moments I have from the Bootcamp are the times that I spend coding. The atmosphere here is amazing and it is fun to interact with people that are all very similar and yet so diverse. So whether it was teaching the instructors how to dance or do a backflip to doing a flash mob there's always a fun time to be had.  I'd say if you want to be really good at coding you need to keep practicing. I know it sounds cheesy but coding isn't one of those things where you can read a book about it or look at someone else's solution to solve a problem.",4/22/2016 10:25,4/22/2016 16:14,0,15,15,0,0,0,0,0,15

829,"Stories behind our coders  Khwezi - 22  I grew up in many different environments. Moving from point A to point B was a trend in my childhood. We only found stability and a home in 2006, in Vosloorus where we currently reside. I was highly shy growing up, I blossomed really late socially in being able to hold conversations with strangers, having emotions, speech reflexes, etc.   This is why, for me, in Bootcamp, the most defining moments were getting to know the people I work with and working as teams. I have always been a terrible team player, but sharing the stories and situations with my fellow Bootcampers really opened my eyes.   Hands down my most memorable moments were learning from one another. Its amazing what one can learn once they take off their earphones, get off their phones and interact with people. I am currently trying to practice this way of life outside of Bootcamp now. Interacting and connecting with the people. Honestly you'd be shocked at how much you can learn just from a simple conversation with the stranger down the street which you formed an opinion on.   All I can say to the prospective coders out there, stop thinking you can do it alone. As capable as you are of doing it alone, it would do you more harm in the long run. You are not alone. Coding is more than intelligence, it's a way of life. A way of community. A culture of collaboration.",4/12/2016 10:42,4/12/2016 19:13,1,78,78,0,0,0,0,0,78

I was raised by a very special woman, my mother, who has always instilled in me the importance of knowledge and working hard for the things you want. Sadly, she is no longer with us, but every lesson she has taught me still remains with me.  I heard about WeThinkCode_ from a friend at work, I had never done any kind of coding but have always been intrigued by the concept. After checking out the website and taking the tests, I just had to give it a try.   The biggest challenge so far has been adjusting to the different approach to learning that they have here at WeThinkCode_. I have been so conditioned for a long time to think and learn in a certain way, whereas here at WeThinkCode_ we are encouraged to be creative, interact and learn from each other.  My goal is to learn as much as I can from as many people as I can.   My favourite quote has always been ""YOU TRY, YOU FAIL, YOU TRY, YOU FAIL. THE REAL FAILURE IS WHEN YOU STOP TRYING"". So never quit on the things you want, learn from your failures, pick yourself up and TRY AGAIN.",4/4/2016 14:56,4/9/2016 19:59,10,81,76,5,0,0,0,0,76

842,"Stories behind our Coders  Jessica - 23  ""I grew up in a small township called Tshepisong. I was raised by my mother Busisiwe Mahlambi who has always been my inspiration, my motivator and most of all my hero.  Growing up I enjoyed solving problems. No matter how difficult they seemed, I would solve them. My friends would at times find me playing one game for hours, just to get it right.  The day I set my eyes on the screen to write the first WeThinkCode_ test, I was amazed to see the complexity of the puzzles I had to solve. I had a smile though because I could tell that this was just another problem I needed to solve. And I loved it!  Bootcamp was not easy at first. When I got there I was shy and felt alone because it was my first time being surrounded by so many people and it was a bit difficult for me to socialize. But after a few days, I managed to shake off the shyness and realised how exciting Bootcamp really is. You get to solve many problems as a team and in a short period of time.  The brain is really flexible, don’t be afraid to explore something new in your life. At WeThinkCode_ you are given the chance to let your brain explore and absorb as much information you need to be the best coder you can be.""",3/22/2016 15:04,3/23/2016 21:22,5,109,106,3,0,0,0,0,106

852,"Stories behind the coders  Gabriel, 24  I have always found it hard to study theory. I am more the hands-on type. I studied a BSc IS at NMMU. I loved programming and excelled at it, but I could not keep up with the electives. In 2014, my 3rd year, I failed to pass and was not allowed back into the course. I then chose the UNISA route. But again I did not fit.   When I heard about WeThinkCode_ it was clear this program was for me: all practical, no theory and a peer to peer learning system.   The Bootcamp was an experience like no other. I set goals to work at least 10 hours each day and to push myself all the time. The vast amount of work covered took me by surprise. Over the course of the 4 weeks, we covered my entire first year and half of my second year of university programming! There was not one day when I felt I could slack off.    My advice to all aspiring coders out there? Never give up! Keep going. There will be days when you will feel that you cannot go anymore and the workload is just too much. Remember that in these times we are the engineers of the future and it is up to us to help shape the future in a positive way. If you don’t give it everything you got, then who will be the next Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg?

Because I have always loved computers and how they work, I started to learn a little bit of coding on my own. I came across WeThinkCode_ and decided to take a chance and go for it!  I worked at my father's restaurant to save some money to be able to get to the Bootcamp everyday.  The most challenging part of the Bootcamp was the time consumption. Waking up every morning to get to campus, but once I'm there, the energy and cooperation of all the coders gave me so much motivation. I learnt so much from the Bootcamp, not just with coding but with socialising with other people who think the same way as you do. I have a lot of goals that I had set during this Bootcamp... I could not achieve all of them yet, but I did achieve one, that is to socialise with everyone and help everyone I possibly could.

856,"Stories behind the coders  Sherwin, 26  I started using computers when I was 9. All I wanted to do at that time was play one game, The Prince of Persia. Growing up I was an introvert, I loved to play on my computer. But not only play, I also learned how to make beats, mix and master. I taught myself graphic design and video editing. When it comes software, I really don’t need a manual. I just love tinkering with it until it does something cool, something I didn’t expect.  My love for technology made me want to study further but due to lack of funds I couldn’t pursue my dream of studying graphic design. I started looking for jobs and one thing they all had in common was the word “advantageous”. They would list a couple skills that would be an advantage for you in getting the job, such as web development, programming in JavaScript, HTML/CSS. I decided that if I can’t afford to study graphic design yet, then I might as well learn programming now. I had to teach myself how to code, and I never once regretted taking that step.  The Bootcamp is really difficult! I have come to realize that it is designed to break you. Not break your mind but more to break your resolve, because everyone wants it. Everyone sacrificed something to be here. But how hard are you willing to work to stay? That’s what defines you here. Nothing worthwhile is ever easy.  If you see a problem, fix it if it’s within your control. If not then don’t complain, because we all know the problem exists.

Those childhood TV Games set me on the road to gaming and a passion towards technology. Somehow, most children grow up with a fondness for gaming because there is always a lesson behind and excitement. My first life-defining moment was when I unexpectedly became Head boy in primary school. This nudged me down a path to achieve what I never thought was possible and push the boundaries of my own limits. I soon followed this path to study accounting at WITS. It was the responsible choice and a choice I thought would make my parents proud. But the responsible option is not always the right option. So I took a two year break to rediscover myself, you could call it a ‘soul searching’ break. This experience was humbling as it taught me several life values, there were moments when I'd feel lost and alone because the answers we need in life often elude us when we need them most. This left me wondering and rethinking many aspects of my life…  As cliche as it may sound, making others happy makes me truly happy. I guess seeing someone smile gives life new meaning.
